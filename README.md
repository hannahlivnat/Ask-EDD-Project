## WELCOME TO THE ASK EDD PROJECT
---------------------------

This is a front-end application serving as a mock-up of an alternative California Ask EDD page. This site addresses several concerns and frustrations of Californians experiencing unemployment during the pandemic -- hard to find answers, an overload of content, difficulty in navigating through information, and inaccessible contact information.

For further information, please refer to our [wiki page](https://github.com/hannahlivnat/Ask-EDD-Project/wiki).
