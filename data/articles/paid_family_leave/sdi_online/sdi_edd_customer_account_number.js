              Your Employment Development Department Customer Account Number
              (EDDCAN) is a unique identification number that is assigned when
              you complete your SDI Online registration. It will initially
              appear in a message on the Successful Account Creation
              Notification section of the Account Setup Confirmation page. This
              number will help limit the use of Social Security numbers as the
              primary source of identification for claimants.
