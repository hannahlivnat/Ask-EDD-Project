      <p>
              You have requested to file a claim for Unemployment Insurance (UI)
              benefits. In order to determine if you worked and earned
              sufficient wages to monetarily qualify to file the claim, the EDD
              needs the complete information for all the employers you worked
              for during the past 18 months, including your very last employer.
      </p>
      <p>
              An <b>Affidavit of Wages</b> (DE 23A) has been mailed to you
              because you have filed a claim for benefits and the EDD needs
              proof of the wages you earned for a past employer. If you still
              wish to receive benefits, as soon as possible, you will need to
              complete, sign, and mail or fax the affidavit, along with your
              proof of earnings for the employer listed on the affidavit to the
              EDD. Remember that there are penalties for providing the EDD with
              false information, which may include administrative penalties and
              fines, in addition to criminal prosecution.{" "}
        <b>As soon as possible after you receive the affidavit(s)</b>
              you will need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fill out the affidavit completely.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Sign</b> the affidavit.
        </li>
        <li>
                  Gather your <b>proof of earnings</b>, such as your W-2 and/or
                  pay stubs.
        </li>
        <li>
                  Fax OR mail the completed and signed affidavit, along with
                  your proof of earnings, to the EDD using the fax number or
                  mailing address provided on the affadavit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
              If the EDD is not able to obtain your work and earnings from your
              former employer(s), the EDD <b>may</b> be able to use the{" "}
        <b>signed affidavit and proof of earnings</b> you provide to file
              your UI claim. If wages are added to your UI claim, you will
              receive a <i>Notice of Amended Unemployment Insurance Award</i>.
              If you believe the amended notice is incorrect, you may contact
              the EDD to request a reconsideration of, or protest the accuracy
              of, the wages and/or the claim.
