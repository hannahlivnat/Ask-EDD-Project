      <p>
        No. You do not need a checking or savings account with Bank of
        America or any other financial institution to receive your benefit
        payments on the Employment Development Department (EDD) Debit
        Card.
      </p>
      <h5>Avoid Fraud. Protect yourself from phishing scams:</h5>
      <p>
        Neither the EDD nor Bank of America will contact you under any
        circumstances to request your EDD Debit Card account number and/or
        PIN. If you are contacted by phone or email and asked for the
        information DO NOT respond. Any direct deposit transfer request
        must be initiated by you through Bank of America.
