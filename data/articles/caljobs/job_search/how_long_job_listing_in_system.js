      <p>
            The period in which a job listing will remain open is determined
            by the employer or the individual that created the job posting.
            The listing will remain open until the position has expired, been
            filled, or removed from the system, whichever comes first.
      </p>
      <p>
            Many job listings are uploaded into CalJOBSSM from Americaâ€™s Job
            Bank (AJB), the federal internet-based labor exchange system, or
            other Private Job Boards (PJB) from the internet.
