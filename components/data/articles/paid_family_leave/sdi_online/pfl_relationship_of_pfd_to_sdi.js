              What is the Relationship of Paid Family Leave to State Disability
              Insurance?
      </h4>
      <p>
              Paid Family Leave (PFL) is a component of the State Disability
              Insurance (SDI) program. Disability Insurance provides benefits to
              workers who have a wage loss when they cannot work because of a
              non-work-related illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth. PFL
              provides benefits to workers who have a wage loss due to the need
              to provide care for a seriously ill child, parent, parent-in-law,
              grandparent, grandchild, sibling, spouse, or registered domestic
              partner, or to bond with a new child entering the family through
              birth, adoption, or foster care placement. To learn more about
