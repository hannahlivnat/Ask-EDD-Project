      <h4>File a Bonding Claim for Paid Family Leave</h4>
      <p>
              If you are currently receiving pregnancy-related disability
              benefits, you may submit your Paid Family Leave (PFL) bonding form
              using SDI Online once your disability benefits have exhausted. The
              Employment Development Department (EDD) will also automatically
              send a paper PFL form DE 2501FP to you when your pregnancy-related
              disability has ended.
      </p>
      <p>
              To file a PFL bonding claim (new mothers without a pregnancy
              disability claim, new fathers, and adoptive/foster parents) using
              SDI Online, you must first complete a one-time registration in
              Benefit Programs Online (BPO) and complete your registration in
              SDI Online. You can file 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To
              register or file in Spanish, select the En espa√±ol link on the BPO
              login page.
      </p>
      <p>
              After you have completed the registration process, you can file
              your claim by following these steps:
