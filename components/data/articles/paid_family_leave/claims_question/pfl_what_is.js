      <h4>What is Paid Family Leave?</h4>
      <p>
              Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides benefits for individuals who lose
              wages when they need time off from work to care for a seriously
              ill child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild,
              sibling, spouse, or registered domestic partner, or to bond with a
              new child entering the family by birth, adoption, or foster care
              placement.
