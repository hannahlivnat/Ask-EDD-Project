          If you think someone is committing fraud against one of the EDD&#39;s
          programs, it is important that you let us know. Allegations of fraud
          are taken seriously, and you can remain anonymous.

          When reporting fraud, include all relevant information.{" "}

              Don’t include your name and phone number if you wish to remain
              anonymous.

          You will not receive a call from the EDD unless more information is
          needed.

          If you already reported fraud and need to provide more information,
          contact the EDD again. Include the reference number provided when you
          first reported the issue.

          not disclose status or provide updates to allegations of fraud, unless
