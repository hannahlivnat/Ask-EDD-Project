        Individuals who contact the EDD to file a new Unemployment
        Insurance (UI) claim that begins April 1, 2012, or after, and do
        not qualify to file a UI claim using the Standard Base Period, may
        be eligible to file a claim using the Alternate Base Period. For
        all individuals who contact the EDD to file a new UI claim, and
        who do not qualify to file a claim using the Standard Base Period,
        the EDD will automatically consider whether they potentially
        qualify to file a claim using the Alternate Base Period. The
        Standard Base Period is the first four of the last five completed
        calendar quarters before the beginning date of the claim. The
        Alternate Base Period is the four most recently completed calendar
        quarters before the beginning date of the claim.

        It is important that all individuals have their complete
        employment information for the past 18 months available when
        contacting the EDD to file a UI claim, including all employers’
        names and complete mailing addresses. If individuals do not have
        the employers’ complete contact information, they may be asked to
        contact the EDD again when they have all the information
        available.
