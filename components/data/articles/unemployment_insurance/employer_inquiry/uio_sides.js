      <p>
            The State Information Data Exchange System (SIDES) is a secure and
            timely way for employers and third party administrators (TPAs) to
            electronically receive and respond to the Employment Development
            Department’s (EDD){" "}
        <i>
          <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de1101cz.pdf">
                    Notice of Unemployment Insurance Claim Filed (DE 1101CZ)
          </a>
        </i>
            .
      </p>
      <p>
            The DE 1101CZ is sent to the last employer, identified by the
            claimant, when a new Unemployment Insurance (UI) claim is filed, or
            when an existing UI claim is reopened. The EDD relies on the last
            employer’s timely and complete response to help determine the
            claimant’s eligibility for benefits and accurately charge an
            employer’s UI reserve account.
      </p>
      <p>
            Using SIDES helps to quickly exchange information between the
            employer and the EDD to save time, save mailing costs, and reduce
            improper payments.
