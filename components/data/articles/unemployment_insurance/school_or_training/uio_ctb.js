      <h6>Program Information</h6>
      <p>
            CTB allows eligible Unemployment Insurance (UI) customers to further
            their education, upgrade their skills, and/or learn a new trade to
            be more competitive in todayâ€™s labor market while receiving UI
            benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
            If approved for CTB, you will be exempt from the requirements to be
            available for work, actively seek work, and accept work, while you
            complete your training. You may also be eligible for additional
            weeks of benefits while completing training or school.
      </p>

        <b>Note</b>: The EDD does not cover any educational or
            training-related expenses such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, or
            transportation. However, there are state, federal, or employer
            programs that may fund your school or training.

      <h6>Signature No Longer Required</h6>
      <p>
            California Training Benefits (CTB) participants are no longer
            required to obtain a signature from the training provider or
            authorized representative when certifying for continued benefits.
            CTB participants are still required to be enrolled in and
            satisfactorily attend the approved training or retraining. The EDD
            may periodically require a CTB participant to obtain verification of
            the training from the training provider or school.

            For faster processing, CTB participants may now submit their
