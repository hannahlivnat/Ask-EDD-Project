          Do I Need An Account with Bank of America to Use My EDD Debit Card?
      </h4>
      <p>
        No. You do not need a checking or savings account with Bank of America or any
        other financial institution to receive your benefit payments on the Employment
        Development Department (EDD) Debit Card.
      </p>
      <h6>Avoid Fraud. Protect yourself from phishing scams:</h6>
      <p>
        Neither the EDD nor Bank of America will contact you under any circumstances to 
        request your EDD Debit Card account number and/or PIN. If you are contacted by phone
        or email and asked for the information DO NOT respond. Any direct deposit transfer request
        must be initiated by you through Bank of America.
