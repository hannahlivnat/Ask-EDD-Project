      <p>
        If you fail to notify the Department of these changes, you may
        cause an overpayment. An overpayment happens when you receive
        Disability Insurance benefits you were not eligible to receive. If
        you knowingly report incorrect information or withhold
        information, then a false statement disqualification of up to 92
        days will be applied. In addition, any resulting overpayment will
        be increased by a 30 percent penalty.
