    <h4>How to Report Fraud</h4>
    <p>
      If you think someone is committing fraud against one of the EDD&#39;s
      programs, it is important that you let us know. Allegations of fraud
      are taken seriously, and you can remain anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      When reporting fraud, include all relevant information. Don’t
      include your name and phone number if you wish to remain anonymous.
      You will not receive a call from the EDD unless more information is
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you already reported fraud and need to provide more information,
      contact the EDD again. Include the reference number provided when
      you first reported the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: To preserve confidentiality and integrity, the EDD does
      not disclose status or provide updates to allegations of fraud,
      unless court ordered or as required by law. The EDD will not
      disclose your identity unless required by law.
    </p>
