    <p>
          Your Employment Development Department Customer Account Number
          (EDDCAN) is a unique identification number that is assigned when you
          complete your SDI Online registration. It will initially appear in a
          message on the Successful Account Creation Notification section of the
          Account Setup Confirmation page. This number will help limit the use
          of Social Security numbers as the primary source of identification for
          claimants.
