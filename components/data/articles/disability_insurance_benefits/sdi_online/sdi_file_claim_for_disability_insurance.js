    <h4>File a Claim for Disability Insurance</h4>
    <p>
          To file a Disability Insurance (DI) claim in SDI Online, you must
          first complete a one-time registration in Benefit Programs Online
          (BPO) and complete your registration in SDI Online. You can file 24
          hours a day, 7 days a week. To register or file in Spanish, select the
          En espa√±ol link on the BPO login page.
    </p>
    <p>
          After you have completed the registration process, you can file your
          claim by following these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
              Log in to your <BPOLink /> account.
      </li>
      <li>
              Select <b>SDI Online</b> which will direct you to your <b>Home</b>{" "}
              page.
      </li>
      <li>
              Select <b>New Claim</b> from the <b>Menu</b>.
      </li>
      <li>
              Select <b>Disability Insurance</b> under the{" "}
        <b>Apply for Disability Insurance Benefits</b>
              header and complete the required information for you claim.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
          Once your claim is submitted, you will be provided with a Receipt
          Number.
    </p>
    <p>
          Give your Receipt Number to the physician/practitioner that will
          provide the certification required for your claim. The Receipt Number
          is necessary whether the physician/practitioner certifies using SDI
          Online or submits a hard copy claim form.
    </p>
    <p>
          Once the claim is complete, a Claim ID number will be provided to use
          for checking the claim status on SDI Online or filing additional
          documentation if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
          All DI claims require a medical certification. If your claim duration
          needs to be extended by the physician/practitioner, provide the Claim
          ID number to the physician/practitioner to file a medical
          certification using SDI Online.
    </p>
    <p>
          You may still file a paper Claim for Disability Insurance (DI)
          Benefits (DE 2501) form. The Optical Character Recognition forms are
          scanned and data is captured in SDI Online for processing. Forms can
