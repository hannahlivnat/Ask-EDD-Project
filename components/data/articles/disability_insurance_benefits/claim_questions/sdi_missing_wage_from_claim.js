              It is important to check the <i>Notice of Computation</i> (DE
              429D), carefully to make sure that all employers you worked for
              during each quarter shown are listed.
      </p>
      <p>
              If an employer is missing, send a letter to the mailing address on
              the DE 429D. Be sure to include your Social Security number, a
              copy of the DE 429D, and copies of any proof of earnings to be
              included (for example, W-2 or paycheck stubs.)
      </p>
      <p>
              If an employer is indicated on the DE 429D that you did not work
              for, or the earnings appear to be incorrect, send a letter to the
              mailing address on the DE 429D and include the same information
              indicated in the paragraph above to report the correct
              information.
